# ate-tracking-generator-module

Implements a dual-channel tracking(ish) Signal Generator built around the (relatively common) AD9833-MCP41010 0 -- 12.5MHz signal generator and the ADS1015 multi-channel ADC modules; also implements an SCPI-like command interface.

Currently tested just on the ATmega-based Arduino platform.
